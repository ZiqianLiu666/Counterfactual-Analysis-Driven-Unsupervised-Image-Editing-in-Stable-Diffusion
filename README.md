# Counterfactual Analysis Driven Unsupervised Image Editing in Stable Diffusion


I have modified the official code to be a bit more robust, enabling it to handle other common datasets. 
(The original official code can only handle a few datasets mentioned in the papers, such as CelebA-HQ.):>


但是最重要的是，我们对任何数据集都采用了unknown作为提示词，所以可以被当作无监督学习。

## 📝 Notes
Our method is inspired by the idea proposed in [Text-to-Image Models for Counterfactual Explanations: a Black-Box Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07944)
